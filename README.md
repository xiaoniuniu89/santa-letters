# UX Design

## <p id="user-stories"> User Stories</p>
- As a user I Want to navigate the web page easily, so I go directly to the page I'm most interested in.
 
- As a user I Want to play Christmas music after completing my letter to Santa, further encapsulating the festive excitement of Christmas, and creating a fun and memorable moment.
 
- As a user I Want to be able to download and print different festive coloring pages, further adding to the festive cheer and excitement.
 
- As a user I Want to see a countdown to christmas timer, to get me excited about the run up to christmas day.
 
- As a user I want to write an interactive letter to Santa so I can send it instantly over the internet.
 
- As a parent of a young user I want a child friendly site free from coarse language so my child will not see anything inappropriate.
 
- As the parent of a young child I want my child to have a letter full of prompts so they can finish the letter, uninhibited by their literacy level.
 
- As a parent I want to use the site on mobile in case I am outside and need to calm my child down by watching the videos they like from the site or to view the timer again.
